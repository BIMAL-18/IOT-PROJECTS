Let's Begin

step 1:
	Open the chrome and the install the arduino app
	
	link : https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE

step 2:
	Open the app

step 3:
	please visit this website 

	https://anipshah.com.np/

step 4:
	
	After that Scroll down the website and then you get the box where you see the Node Mcu Installation.

	Direct Link : https://www.instructables.com/Steps-to-Setup-Arduino-IDE-for-NODEMCU-ESP8266-WiF/

step 5: 

	After that you see the page of the Steps to "Setup Arduino IDE for NODEMCU ESP8266"  Title on that website 

step 6:

	After that you see the Step by step process for doing that process to connect your computer/laptop with the microcontroller

step 7:

	click on the preference by clicking the left corner of the of the Arduino then you see preference 

	Shortcut Key : (ctrl,) [Note : You can also go on it by clicking the ctrl and comma)

step 8:

	After You enter in the Preference you see the option of the ESP8266 Board Manager
	
	Then in this option add the editor size font 12 or you can also adjust your font according to your need

step 9:
	
	Then in the Compiler Warning inside preference then you just tick down the 

	Verify code after upload
 
	Autosave

step 10:

	In the bottom you see the option of the Additional Boards Manager URL

	in this box just paste this link 

	Link : http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json


step 11:

	After that go to the tool and then just click on the 
	
	Board Manager and Select Arduino Uno

Step 12:
	
	After than In the Column 2nd Option under file U see the Board Manager in this type 

	ESP8266 

	and install this package 

step 13:
	
	After that open the tool and then go to the board and select the 

	NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP_12E Module)

step 14:

	After that You should given the code 


        You can also access This code From GitHub

Step 15:

	just copy this code and add this code to your New file that you create 

Step 16:

	After Running your code You see there Many Error Like 

	Error :  MAX30100_PulseOximeter.h this library error

Step 17:

	You Need to install the library in this such as 

	MAX30100 Library
	U8g2
	
	[Note :
		 Question:

			   How can i know which library should be install

		 Solution :

			   Just copy the Error Inside " " then paste it to the google then you will be able to Know which error Was Occurred

			   And then Just install that Library from the Library inside "Library Manager" Which you can see inside the Arduino app


	]

step 19:
	
	If this Library can't install at that case you can acess this file through a GitHub Link of Me

	GitHub : GitHub.com/BIMAL-18


Step 20:

	After that You see this Message :
	
	Screenshot 2024-12-22 180619.png
	[.Variable and Constants in Ram(global, Static)


Step 21:

	After that you have provided the Zip File

	Zip File : CP210x_Windows_Drivers_with_Serial_Enumeration.zip

	You can Also access this file from the GitHub

	GitHub.com/BIMAL-18

Step 22:

	After Extract the Zip file then click on this 
	
	and install the application:


	CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe

	
Step 23:

	After that You can see at the top Version name "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP_12E Module)"

	After click on that you can see the option of "Other board and POrts"

	Just click on that 
	
	Just connect that port that You have given by sir

step 24:

	After that You can see the Circuit that you have given then just join it and chk
	
	[Note : Circuit is also I provided it on Guithub]

	
Step 25:

	Circuit Drawing 

	For this Install the app Name 

	App Name : Cirkit Designer(app)

	Link : https://www.cirkitdesign.com/download.html

Step 26:

	After that You should Click Create on New File Then :

	1) Node MCU V3 ESP8266

	2) MAX30102 Heart Rate and Oxygen Sensor

		[Note : You can also Get this from the search box type MAX30102]
	
	3) 0.96"OLED
		[Note : You can also get this by just typing "OLED"]

	And connect the wire

Step 27:

	Picture of Circuit I will Upload on GitHub just and see it and join the connection on it
